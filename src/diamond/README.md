# Mastery TDD - Diamond

Write a class that takes a letter as an input and writes a diamond with the letter as the widest point.
For example, the diamond for the letter C is :

      A
     B B
    C   C
     B B
      A


# Hint

Tackle the problem one step at the time and split between creating the data-structure and printing it.
You can run your tests against a string, but it's easier to test against the individual lines of an array.
